# Back to Completable Future: Concurrency in Action

This repository was created to hold information related to one of my talks on Concurrency. The main idea behind this talk is to address common misconceptions of concurrency being inherently complex in Java, and that the developer experience has significantly improved since the initial introduction of Threads and Runnables.

One of the recordings of this talk could be found here: https://youtu.be/i3iDIP4PTLk
